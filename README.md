# Planka App

Planka App is an open-source mobile application developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). It integrates with the [Planka](https://github.com/plankanban/planka) open-source project management platform via its API, allowing users to manage boards, lists, and tasks from their mobile devices.

## Features

- **Board Management**: Create and manage project boards.
- **Task Lists**: Organize tasks into lists for better workflow management.
- **Task Management**: Add, update, delete, and organize tasks (cards) across lists.

## Issues

If you find any bugs or want to suggest new features, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/randomdev05/planka_app/issues).

## Info

In the current App state, you will have to often refresh or go back to the boards and then back into whereever you were again. This is due to no caching at the moment. Planning to add this in the next Version. So keep in mind. The changes youÂ´ve made are already on the Server, just not showing instantly.
